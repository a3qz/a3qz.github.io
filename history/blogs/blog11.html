How do video games impact social issues such as addiction and gun violence? Should video games be more heavily regulated, or is the current ESRB sufficient? Are games a symptom, a cause, or possibly a cure for modern social ills?<br />
<br />
Personally, I think that video games have a relatively low impact on social issues like gun violence.  However, I do think that they, like many other modern activities such as social media, can be problematic for those at risk for behavioral addiction.  The article from Psychology Today suggests at something that I have heard reported before, and additionally something that I would say I have seen in my own personal experience.  That is, the two biggest psychological impacts of video games to a gamer.  The first of these is the impact on cognitive function, specifically, their "spatial cognition", e.g., the ability to visualize and understand how things are represented in a space.  This makes sense to me; every time I pick up a new game, the first thing happens before I really feel comfortable with a game is understand how the game world is laid out and how it connects with itself.  Once I have a spatial understanding, I can then begin to understand the mechanics.  The second impact, and the one with more impact on social issues, is the way that games can have an impact on your brains rewards centers.  Like aforementioned article says, "video gaming raises dopamine levels in the brain to about the same degree that eating a slice of peperoni pizza or dish of ice cream does (without the calories)."  It therefore, in my mind, follows that a lot of gamers probably play games a lot more than the average person eats pizza or ice cream, and that there are probably negative impacts of that on things like their capacity to be addicted.  <br />
<br />
In terms of video games and gun violence, I think they are definitely being scapegoated because they are an easy target moreso than because they are actually linked.  If you had me guess, individuals with violent tendencies are probably drawn to violent video games, not that the violent games create violent people.  Growing up, there was only one games whose in game violence my parents were worried we were carrying out in real life, and that is Harry Potter and the Quidditch World Cup.  The ars technica article mentions the "ongoing bureaucratic freeze, which has essentially stymied gun-violence research since the passage of the Dickey amendment in 1996."  I do not personally belive that there is a connection with gaming to this specific issue, but I think that more unbiased research on it, as well as other factors that effect gun violence in individuals, would be a good thing.  <br />
<br />
I think that the ESRB is currently sufficient.  I have never once played a game where I felt like the ESRB rating on it was too low.  In fact, I can think of a couple of incidents where they made it too high for what I would consider minor infractions; e.g., Blizzard's Heroes of the Storm removing a character's signature cigar in order to keep the rating down, because tobacco use would put it into the next bracket in some countries.  Any store that sold games that I have been to is very good about making sure the purchaser is of the appropriate age to buy a game.  However, there is nothing stopping a parent for buying a game that is inappropriate for their child.  I prefer to think of ESRB ratings as maturity level constraints more so than age based.  People mature at different rates, but by the time they are old enough to buy any game on their own, they should be mature enough to handle it.  However, it is really up to parents to engage with their children and determine the maturity level of game that they are able to handle.  For various reasons, when it comes to games, it seems like parents are much less in the loop than with things like movies, books, or tv.  My parents would watch movies with us as kids all the time, but very rarely did they ever join in our video gaming experiences.   <br />
<br />
I think that any ills of games are most likely to be a symptom of modern social ills more than anything else.  Like any art form, I also think that they do have the potential to be a cure for these social ills, however, change like that has to occur over a long period of time.  Even right now, a relatively small number of games attempt to deal with complex social problems, and even fewer do so with incredible success.  <br />
