    <h1>Reading 00: A Mutual Relationship</h1>
    <p>
        Traditional board games and modern video games today have a relationship that is very back and forth.  As discussed in the Vice article "It's Official, Everyone: Board Games Are Cool Now", the modern gaming space is shared between the two formats.  There exists both a friendly competition between them, as "there's a huge amount of crossover between the two, and many gamers play both", and therefore, both formats are vying for the attention of their target demographics.  However, both game formats also are growing together in more ways than one.  Like we see in the article in The Guardian about the changing boundaries, PC or mobile adaptations of popular board games have always existed.  Monopoly has been present on almost every video game console, and popular newer games have gained even more attention thanks to their various digital adaptations such as the Ticket to Ride mobile app.  This gives players opportunities that the regular cardboard version doesn't have, such as the ability to play games over long distances, the ability to play alone, and the ability to play anywhere without bringing along your whole boxed game.  In addition, some games have been able to take advantage of technology and the video game space to make enhancements that make gameplay more fluid.  For example, one game I play called One Night Ultimate Werewolf requires a phase where a player acts as a narrator and reads off descriptions of the actions other players must take while their eyes are closed.  The instructions are quire long and some are very nuanced, so this is a potential point of friction during gameplay.  However, the game also comes with a mobile app companion that you can set up to do this instruction reading for you - and once you are used to playing with that, it is almost impossible to return to the manual reading format.  Finally, the last category of ways that the formats directly impact each other is games that take a concept from board games and push it further with the advantages of technology.  Again, as noted in the article, the game that is probably the best example of this is Blizzard's Hearthstone.  I remember when I was in high school, around a year after I had started playing Magic the Gathering, I got the invite to participate in the closed beta for Hearthstone.  As I began playing it and of course comparing and contrasting it with my other card game experiences, I noticed very quickly the advantages that it had.  For example, Magic the Gathering has a mechanic wherein each creature heals to the amount of life printed on its card at the end of each turn.  The Pokemon Trading Card Game, on the other hand, requires the use of dice or tokens in order to mark how much damage a creature has taken thus far.  This is clearly an inconvenience to the players as the have to fiddle around with tokens in order to interact with the central mechanic of the game.  However, simply by being on the computer, Hearthstone does not have to deal with any of this at all, as it can just be calculated and displayed on the board by the computer.  It furthermore has its own mechanics that are not even possible with a regular trading card game.  There are several spells in the game whose effect is to cast a random spell from the rest of the game.  This is not limited to which cards that player owns, which is something that in a paper game would be very prohibitive, as it is incredibly expensive to possess every single card in the game (not to mention probably nearly impossible to hunt down).   Neither video games nor board games exist in a bubble on their own, and those who design games for either format are only hindering themselves if they remain ignorant of the trends and the history of the other.  Each format has its own advantages, like the rewarding sensation of playing with a group of friends in real life in a board game, or the ability to play with friends all around the world without leaving your own home in a video game.  But as the two formats continue to learn from each other's successes and failures, in my opinion, it will result in both of them improving.  And as an avid gamer of all formats, that is something that I support wholeheartedly.
