The biggest differences, for me, about gaming on a personal computer vs a video console are the number of options.  This is true both in terms of software and hardware.  In the end, I consider the differences between them to be analogous to their advantages and disadvantages.  <br />
One difference that is impossible to overlook is the practicality of gaming on a computer vs gaming on a console.  If you get a computer that is powerful enough for gaming, then it is 100% capable of also doing things like word processing, web browsing, and probably most levels of software development as well.  That being said, there are also two drawbacks to that.  One is that you are basically locked to windows, as the gaming scene on Mac and Linux is just not even comparable.  Another is slightly more specific, but for many gamers, they will probably be spending their day jobs working in front of computers.  That can make it harder to go home and want to spend more time on the computer - between the psychological effect of being in the same environment as your work one, and just the "distraction" from gaming by things like email, it can be hard to do.  Many may just find it more relaxing to play games from the couch in front of the tv as opposed to at a desk in front of their computer screen.  <br />
Another one category that is both a disadvantage and an advantage to each type of gaming is game compatibility.  When you buy a game for a console that is designed for that console, you know that it is going to work.  When you buy a game for a personal computer, you need to make sure that your computer has strong enough graphics power to be able to play it.  You also need to make sure that you have a compatible operating system.  However, this also allows some flexibility.  If you only play games that are less graphically intensive - for example, side scrolling retro style platformers, or ascii art dungeon crawlers, you could be saving money by buying a cheap computer instead of spending the full price on a console.   <br />
Another potential factor is input methods.  On PC, you can attach a controller, or use mouse and or keyboard, or use any other peripheral you can find that connects over usb.  On console, you pretty much must use either an official controller or a third party knock off.  Alternative control schemes, like fight sticks or racing wheels exist, but the selection is substantially smaller than the selection of alternatives on PC.  <br />
A final big difference is legacy support.  Some consoles have had better backwards compatibility than others - for example, the Wii could play all GameCube games, but the Switch cannot play any Wii or Wii U games.  The PC, on the other hand, does not have problems like that at all.  For this assignment, I was playing games from the 80s with no problems in the slightest.  <br />
In terms of types of games, there are definitely some games that play better on console than on PC. However, I do not think that it is super relevant these days because it is easy enough to find a controller for your PC that will work with your computer with no additional configuration - and the control scheme is the reason that I think games can be better on console.  That being said, there are examples of games that are quite platform reliant.  The best example of this is the real time strategy game.  Because of both the large number of required buttons and the required precision of the controls, it is a genre very difficult to play without a mouse and keyboard.  On the other side, third person platformers are hard to play without controllers because they perform much better when they are controlled by a device with analog joysticks instead of discrete keyboard buttons.   <br />
In conclusion, really, what it comes down to for which is better has more to do with personal preference and priorities.  It is not fair to say one is unquestionably better than the other.  That being said, it is still good to have this discussion in order to keep us all informed consumers.  <br />
