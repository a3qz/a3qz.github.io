For this week, I watched a recording the final game of the first Dota 2 International, as well as some clips from a Hearthstone tournament this weekend.  <br />

I really enjoyed the experience; however, I am definitely biased.  I have been following ESports since I was a sophomore in high school, I have definitely already bought into it.  I think it is really enjoyable to watch professionals at the top of their field play and strategize.  I have recently been watching Hearthstone the most of any ESport because I find it enjoyable to backseat game and try and figure out what I would do in their situations and learn from how the pros react in order to improve my own game.  <br />
<br />
I think that ESports and competitive gaming are a fun activity.  I have never really been a competitor, though I did play in a StarCraft 2 tournament once in high school.  I have been a casual spectator for many years; I don’t exactly watch or follow it avidly, but so much ESports content is put out that it is great to put on for background noise when doing busy work.   The games I have played and followed are League of Legends, Dota 2, StarCraft 2, and Hearthstone.  I have also played games like CS: GO and Overwatch, but I only played casually and never looked into the professional scene.  I do not think that it will or should reach the level of an Olympic event.  Most of the sports in the Olympics are a highly focused test of physical skill or prowess.  In my mind, ESports ranks more along with competitive chess or go. Both are taken quite seriously.  However, I don’t think anyone is really complaining that the two of those are not in the Olympics.  I do think that ESports could benefit from receiving more press than it currently does.  I do not have the unrealistic expectations that one day, a high-profile League of Legends player will have the same profile as a high-profile football player.  However, I do think that there are large segments of its potential audience that are missing out because they dismiss it firsthand.  There are games that I have spent way more time watching than I have ever or will ever spend playing, for various reasons.  For example, in Hearthstone, in order to actually have the cards you need to play at a competitive level, you need to spend a lot more money than I am willing to spend.  Thus, I am content to just watch.  Another example of the missing audience is something that actually occurred last night.  Though not an ESport, while there were people in my room doing systems and data structures homework, I put on some videos of Mario Maker, and one of the students in the room commented how they felt like they couldn’t stop watching even though they thought it was a dumb idea to watch people play video games on the internet.  I don’t necessarily thing competitive gaming is something for everyone, but I do think there is a pretty good chance that it is for a lot more people that those who currently are involved in it.  <br />
