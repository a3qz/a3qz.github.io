			Reading 01: I still had fun
		</h1>Sat, January 27, 2018<p>Early video gaming presented interesting challenges to developers in multiple interesting ways.  The first is that the technology that was available to developers was incredibly limited.  For instance, as we saw in the commercial that we watched in class, the Magnavox Odyssey did not have any graphical capabilities at all; all that it really did was render lights on the screen and make them move corresponding to the paddles.  In order to implement graphics, instead of rendering them digitally on the screen, you instead would do put what is basically a window cling with a pattern on the screen to simulate objects in a game, or "boards", like they would become called in the early arcade scene.  In addition, some games just literally had physical pieces or cards that would be used to supplement the game.  That point brings me to the next, less obvious, limitation is that of the knowledge of the players.  These days, when you make a game, for many of the segments of the market, you can operate on the assumption that the majority of your players have a certain amount of shared knowledge.  An example from a different era is Lakitu in Super Mario 64.  This game was the first time that a Mario game took place in third person and in three dimensions.  In this game, in order to work in three dimensions, the player needed to be able to control the camera.   These days, in a third person platforming game, a developer can assume that the idea of a nebulous floating camera is something that the players are familiar with, whereas in 96, Nintendo felt the need to explain that by putting in a character (Lakitu), and showing that they are literally always flying behind the player character holding a camera, and that when you change the camera angles, you are actually moving the character that is flying behind you.  What that long-winded example illustrates is the way that knowledge of a player base of gams changes over time.  An interesting example of that could be seen in the Buzzfeed article about Pong.  When the author states that Baer said: “Pong is simply a knockoff of the Odyssey Ping-Pong game,” that is already an example of the evolution of games based on shared knowledge.  As technology advanced, instead of overlaying a window cling of a tennis match onto the screen, pong consoles could feel comfortable just representing the paddles and blocks on their own, and the restriction of movement and intuitive physics told the story for themselves.   In the same way, players were also affected by the lack of technology.  For example, with most games of today, if you handed someone with just basic familiarity with games, they would probably be able to figure out how a game works based on its visual feedback and instructions.  However, in games like the haunted house game on the Odyssey, without the overlay, it would literally just be two lights moving around the screen.  Even with the overlay, you would need to read the manual to actually understand what "game" was trying to be played.  Compared to games now, you definitely had to do a lot more work yourself for output that was substantially lower.  That being said, I still think that it is good to look back at old games.  I really enjoyed playing Spacewar! in class, and that game definitely predates the home console market.  Just because something is simple and directionless doesn’t mean it isn’t a good study for those interested in game design, and it definitely doesn’t mean that it isn’t fun - it just might not capture the attention for quite as long as whatever new game genre that everyone is talking about that the water cooler does.    <br />
