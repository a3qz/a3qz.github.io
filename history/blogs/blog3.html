			Reading 02: Beauty in Simplicity 
		</h1>Sat, February 3, 2018<p><br />
In my opinion, the thing that makes the games of the golden age so memorable is definitely their simplicity.  If you take a game like Centipede, Asteroids, or Missile Command, it hardly takes more than a couple of seconds to describe the entire main mechanic of the game.  When you compare that to many of the most popular games of the past several years, such as Assassins Creed, Call of Duty, or the Elder Scrolls, there are so many deeper and nested mechanics built into the games that it is hard to give the full account of a game in a review, let alone in a single sentence.  Because the games of the golden age are so boiled down and focused due to the necessary constraints imposed by the hardware and software available, it made sure that they would stay memorable.  <br />
<br />
For me, nostalgia does not factor at all into my appreciation for the classics.  Growing up, the earliest console that I had played was introduced in 1991 (the SNES).  I did not really play games from the golden age until much later in my gaming career, so I do not think nostalgia is a factor.  When we talk about the gaming community as a whole, sure, it is definitely possible that some nostalgia exists, but based on the current climate, any nostalgia really feels like it is more of manifestation of respect for history than actual memories of the times.  Back then, gaming was definitely substantially less mainstream than it is now.  Having talked to my dad about gaming when he was growing up, his experience with it is more along the lines of having one friend who had an Atari that sometimes him and his friends would go over to play on.  Even though I, growing up with multiple generations of gaming consoles in the house, am probably in a position of having experienced more games than the average person, anecdotally, it seems like around the Gameboy Advance, Nintendo DS, and Nintendo Wii eras, almost everyone I went to school with and hung out with had at least one of those if not multiple.  Since it is not just nostalgia, I think it definitely possible that there are timeless lessons to be learned.  Like I have discussed, there are a lot of things that attract us to new games that did not exist back then.  The most obvious is graphics - these days I can find myself attracted to a game based on nothing but how good it looks.  Back then, it was a lot harder to mask the "fun" of a game behind other cool features.  The games whose mechanics have lasted up until modern times lasted because they are actually fun and rewarding, not because they have anything else going for them.  <br />
<br />
Compared to modern games, the classic games biggest strengths are also their biggest weaknesses.   As much as I have been praising their simplicity, this simplicity also can leave some to be desired at times.  When I sit down with the intent of playing video games to pass the time, I can easily sink several hours in to games like Middle Earth: Shadow of War or The Golf Club 2, but I really donâ€™t fee like I can spend more than a handful of minutes playing any one game on a golden age system.  For me, it takes until around the NES for games I can really sink time into to appear.  This is definitely the difference that keeps me grounded in newer systems the most.  <br />
