    <h1>Reading 01: To be a Hack</h1>
    <p>
        Based on the readings and my experience, a hacker is someone who acts based on certain impulses.  The best way to evaluate whether or not someone is a hacker is, in my opinion, to examine what their motivation is.  My idea of a hacker in terms of computing is not the more modern definition of someone who cracks systems, but is more in line with someone who modern culture would now call a maker; e.g., I will be using hacker in the same way that readings in the articles under numbers 1 and 2 do.  Thus, I feel as though a hacker needs to be someone who creates something within the realm of technology, or someone who explores and uses someone else's creation in a completely new way.  However, if that were the only stipulation for being a hacker, it would not give a full picture.  As Paul Graham says in "Hackers and Painters", "Sometimes what the hackers do is called \"software engineering,\" but this term is just as misleading".  It is totally possible, and in fact it happens all the time, that software is created by software engineers, but that does not necessarily make a software engineer a hacker.  It is definitely possible that someone is both, and in fact in my career, I expect myself to be in that boat.  This comes back to my focus on the motivation.  A hacker creates not because they are trying to create a product for profit, or because they are trying to solve a problem that is pressing in on the world, but because they enjoy the challenge and the creative outlet.  Again, I feel like Paul Graham puts it best when he says, " you have the hackers, who are trying to write interesting software, and for whom computers are just a medium of expression".  The motivation is not external, it comes from within, out of the passion of the hacker, just like an artist in a more traditional expressive medium.  This is reflected in the ideal of the "Hands on Imperative".  Therefore, the key characteristics of a hacker archetype are that someone is passionate about technology for its own sake, and expresses this passion through creative actions.

        I definitely personally identify with these attributes.   When I was reading through " A Portrait of J. Random Hacker", I was pleasantly surprised how many of the attributes it discusses describe me to a t; even the less consequential and less technology related characteristics such as holding the opinion that "sports are something one*does*, not something one watches on TV".  More directly, I also consider myself to be someone that enjoys the process of creation and discovery that is identified with hacking.  As I discussed in my first blog for this class, several of the experiences that pushed me towards studying computer science and pursuing a career in software engineering are to do with trying to play with the code and assets of different computer games that I liked to play, just for the sake of curiosity.  Like in the essay "How yuppies hacked the Hacker Ethos", I believe that "hacking, in my world, is a route to escaping the shackles of the profit-fetish, not a route to profit".  Personally, I react incredibly well to being characterized as a hacker.  On one hand, it is not necessarily a good thing or a bad thing, as it has more to do with opinion and nature than anything particularly active.  Thus, I am not totally sold that it is a good thing to take pride in.  That being said, it is definitely a part of me that I enjoy and find satisfaction in, so it is still something that I am okay to say that I am positive about.  However, I also do not think that it is entirely a positive.  For instance, articles and opinions such as the one by Mark Zuckerberg tend to frustrate me or at the very least rub me the wrong way.  In this way, I felt like I really connected with the "How yuppies hacked the Hacker Ethos".  I have found, in my personal life and during interactions with classmates and coworkers, that I have a hard time interacting and empathizing with those that belong to the "preppy tech entrepreneur class".  I am not driven at all by money; I want to make enough such that I can live my chosen lifestyle comfortably and not have to worry, however, beyond that, I care a lot more about being able to enjoy what I do and who I become than do what makes me the most "successful".  All I want to do is hack for its own sake, and sometimes I can have a harder time relating or communicating with peers that have different forces driving them.  All in all, though, I think that this is a part of myself that I can be content with, and that I will be able to work around its disadvantages to be able to be a productive member of society.
