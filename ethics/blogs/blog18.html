			Reading 14: Computer Science for All?  
		</h1>Sat, April 28, 2018<p><br />
I do not really believe that coding is the new literacy.  I do think that computer literacy could be argued to be the new literacy, and basic understanding of code is somewhat helpful for that, but not entirely.  I think it is maybe not necessary for everyone to be exposed, but I think that at least at the university level there should definitely be some exposure, if not by late high school.  <br />
<br />
The arguments for introducing coding to everyone are, from what I can tell from the readings, two parts.  The first, and in my opinion, more compelling, are those of "Is Coding the New Literacy?", which explain how it is not necessarily coding itself, but the principle of computational thinking that is what is needed and therefore needs to be taught.  The other argument, though also compelling, I think is harder to defend, which is the idea that computers are more and more ubiquitous, and that it therefore must be important to understand them.  There are several arguments against as well.  One of these, addressed again in "Is Coding the New Literacy", is that the issue stems a lot from implementation, citing everything from "boring curricula to a lack of qualified teachers to the fact that in most states computer science doesnâ€™t count toward graduation requirements."  Another more philosophical argument comes from those like Jeff Atwood, who points out many flaws with teaching everyone to program such as reasoning that this movement "falsely equates coding with essential life skills like reading, writing, and math." He also proposes several other criticisms, such as how there is more to software engineering than just understanding how to write code, and how more people writing bad or unprofessional code might actually not be a great thing.  I think that schools will have a very hard time finding resources and teachers that will have even a basic ability to teach in appropriate ways for computer science and their target student age group.  <br />
<br />
I think that computer science would probably fit into the K-12 curriculum as an elective that is an addition instead of a replacement.  For example, my high school, though it cut its CS program before I arrived there, initially allowed you to take it as a replacement for your one non-required spot; e.g., your options after your required math, science, history, English, and foreign language, were economics, a second science, a second language, art or music, or CS.  I think that is probably an optimal way to handle it.  My high school also required all freshman to take a 1 semester speech class.  I think also requiring a 1 semester computer class would have been nice as well.  I think that at the younger levels, a mix of computational thinking and computer literacy are what should be taught.  Focusing on one specific language or implementation is not that important; what will be relevant when you get out of college is probably not the same as when you were in middle school.  The thing that I think is more important to learn in class is just as much the engineering process than the actual nitty gritty of writing code.  <br />
<br />
I go back and forth on whether or not anyone can learn to program.  Most of the time, I feel like with enough practice and good instruction, I feel like anyone can.  However, there have been interactions that I have had with others that make me question that.  These primarily come from my experience with non-computer science friends needed to program in random classes they are in, and from my experience as a teaching assistant for classes early in the CS curriculum.  With most people, if they work hard enough and manage to see the big picture, eventually there is usually a breakthrough where they understand.  However, there have been a small number of people that I have worked with who seem to be unable to grasp even the most basic structures of imperative programming.  Some of these people I would definitely consider more intelligent than myself, having seen excel in other areas that I know I would not be capable of.  However, I think in the general case, the way that programming works is in general consistent with how humans think and communicate, and most people should be able to learn it.  I do not think that everyone should necessarily learn how to program.  For many people, it is simply not an ability that will be relevant enough for their careers or daily lives to be worth the massive time investment that programming can be.  I do think that more people should learn about it than currently do - especially those receiving education at elite universities.  I would imagine that the majority of careers that graduates from these universities will be entering in would benefit from them having a better understanding of how computers work and how to use programming to their advantage.  Few white-collar jobs are doable without computers in this day and age, and even the simplest tasks can be enhanced with some basic computer automation.  I discussed an example in a blog a while ago of a friend who taught their dad how to use the command line on his mac, and he used it to organize his contacts in a spreadsheet.  I think that a required college course that taught basic, practical uses of a friendly language with a lot of resources could go a long way.  I think a more computer literate workforce and academic staff would be necessary in order to bring the changes that I would like.  <br />
One article that I did not like or agree with at all is "Jason Bradbury: Coding in school is a waste of time".  I do not think that toys that allow simplified versions of programming show that programming is a waste of time.  At the most obvious level, clearly someone who does understand the lower level programming will always be needed.  It took a long time for us to even get to a point where compilers are substantially better than someone manually writing out lower level code themselves.  There will always be some level where the abstraction breaks down, and someone needs to understand the basic level.  On another level, I further disagree that programming in the future will not look like programming does now.  As humans, the best way that we have for expressing complicated and interconnected concepts has always been and will always continue to be words.  However, computers, just like other people, will never be able to perfectly understand what someone is trying to communicate in words.  That is why our current programming languages are made up of words that we give specific meanings, and languages that are recursively enumerable, and designed so that they can be converted to machine code (more or less) unambiguously.  This will never go away.  Text is an incredibly efficient, portable, and accessible method of interaction, and to do anything serious, repeatable, and rigorous, it will be needed at some point.  <br />
<br />
What these schools want to teach people is the engineering process, not how to code.  I think that is a great relevant and useful thing.  <br />
