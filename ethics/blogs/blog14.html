			Reading 10: Trolling  
		</h1>Sat, March 31, 2018<p><br />
From both the readings and my personal experience, trolling is the concept of individuals or groups intentionally acting in ways that are either inflammatory or highly critical.  I would tend to personally disagree with some of the articles we saw, like in "What happened when I confronted my cruelest troll" - in my experience, I would not call the people that she was dealing with trolls.  I would say that they definitely crossed the line into stalkers, abusers, and harassers.  When I think of a troll, I more think of people that are saying stupid flaming things just to cause trouble, not to personally attack someone.  I think this behavior usually manifests itself in posts in areas where typically several opinions or ideas are assumed to be held by everyone in the community, and the troll goes in with a dissenting or critical opinion that is clearly meant to emotionally trigger the others in the community.  Its causes are, as far as I know, a desire to be annoying or to "watch the world burn".  Maybe there is a deeper rooted emotional cause for this, like the bully in the previously mentioned article, who told the author that he harassed her because "I think my anger towards you stems from your happiness with your own being. It offended me because it served to highlight my unhappiness with my own self."  Cyberbullying is like real life bullying carried out of the internet.  It is when an individual or individuals constantly harass their victims.  It is different from regular bullying because it is a lot harder to give the bullies consequences for their actions.  <br />

I think that most technology companies do not have obligations to prevent or suppress online harassment actively, but they should have mechanics in place for someone finding a way to get away from harassers if possible.  For example, having reporting and blocking features that are actively used and monitored is basically required in my opinion.  However, I do not think that in the case of sites for general interaction, like Twitter and Facebook, should not censor content.  Places that are specified for certain topics, like forums, I can justify "censoring" content in order to keep the conversation on topic.  <br />

I think that Gamergate was an evidence of the potential dangers of the anonymity of the internet, but I don’t think that it would be worth correcting to change how things work.  The "deluge of negative attention, abuse, threats, and harassment" (The death of the “gamers” and the women who “killed” them) that those involved received or gave were obviously unethical and wrong.  However, harassment and abuse are rampant offline as well, so I do not think targeting anonymity is the answer.  <br />
<br />
I do not have a ton of experience with cyberbullying because I was for the most part offline until high school.  However, as someone who experienced a lot of bullying in middle school, I can only imagine that cyberbullying is a huge problem.  I think that the best way that could be handled is at the discretion of parents, limiting which things their children have access to until they are old enough and mature enough to make their own decisions.  <br />
<br />
Trolling is major on the internet, but I do not see it as a major problem.  I would not classify myself as s troll, but I have enjoyed witnessing trolls begin flame wars on various discussion threads.  My approach to handling them is to do my own research and form my own opinions, and not care what random people on the internet say.  <br />
<br />
I think real name policies are harmful.  When one anonymous person is mean to another, little harm is done.  But when one of those people has their actual identity attached, it opens them up to harassment that goes way too far.  <br />
<br />
I think that the anonymity on the internet is both a blessing and a curse.  What it comes down to is that there are both good and bad people out there that participate in both good and bad forms of communication.  The internet can be both a wasteland of pointless content while at the same time connecting people and creating new ideas all over the world.  It has changed the communication game in so many ways that it is kind of like we live in a new world now.  I think the best good that can come out of an online dialogue is both people participating in it leaving with a grown understanding of themselves and the world.  <br />
