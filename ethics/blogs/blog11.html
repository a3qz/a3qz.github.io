The reading on the landing page of Microsoft Azure says that Cloud Computing is "cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and more—over the Internet".  In my personal experience, I would tend to agree with this admittedly very broad statement.  The term cloud computing has been thrown around so much in internet circles recently that it really cannot afford to have much more of a precise definition than "something you access via the internet".  The ethical issues regarding it mostly have to do with trust and ownership.  One example of this is discussed in the article from CNBC "Credit reporting firm Equifax says data breach could potentially affect 143 million US consumers" describes the massive amount of data on US citizens that was leaked in a breach on the Equifax data.  It clearly demonstrates one violation of the trust we put in the cloud that our information is safe.  When deciding to trust the cloud or not, I think that meme is totally valid to keep in mind - just that "someone else" probably means "Amazon's".   <br />

As a developer, the primary advantages of the cloud are impact me are that development is fairly consistent across platforms, and that it keeps costs reduced.  It is "cross platform" because it is relatively simple to either just have a webpage or to make a basic gui that performs almost no logic while keeping the backend completely consistent.  It cuts down on cost because, as said in the Azure explanation page, cloud providers "typically charge for cloud computing services based on usage".  Since my usage is really low, I cannot really afford to buy and run my own server.  I have used the cloud several times in different projects, both in full stack applications for internships and for simple hobby projects.  I definitely will continue to use it in the future, because I cannot really afford to deal with the inconveniences of another method of server hosting.  <br />

As a consumer, the advantage of the cloud for me is that I can go anywhere and use any device I wish and still have whatever I need.  As someone who regularly uses a variety of different devices, like a laptop, phone, tablet, and lab computer, it is nice to never have to worry about transferring files anywhere.  The disadvantages are that if I don’t have a connection to the internet, it is a lot harder to get anything done than if I was not so connected to the cloud.  Alternatively, the disadvantage is also that I cannot control if the other side has a connection.  Network outages do happen - the worst example of this that I remember is probably the AWS outage discussed in the ars technical article "Amazon cloud sputters for hours, and a boatload of websites go offline".  When a big hosting provider has problems, it can have a negative impact on users, and can leave them with no options.  I regularly use cloud services for file storage.  I also use Github for my source control.  I used to use Google Docs a lot for writing documents but have since moved back to doing things locally.  <br />
<br />
At the end of the day, the trade off that is being made is the between the control over your own systems vs the convenience and reduced cost of using the cloud.  When using the cloud, we do not have control of our own security, and we have no idea where our data is going and who is looking at it.  For those reasons, I do not think that I can really say that I trust the cloud.  That being said, I really do not think that it is very feasible to operate in this day and age without being locked into the cloud.  Like in the example in the Slate article "Why you shouldn’t trust your data to "the cloud"", apparently you cannot even sync an iPhone calendar to your phone over a cable anymore.  <br />
