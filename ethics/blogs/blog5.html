In summary, our code of ethics is broken up into five distinct categories.  These categories are: Responsibility, Honesty, Contribution to Community, Respect, and Doing the Right Thing.  Responsibility contains guidelines about putting forth effort in what you do and honoring what is required of you.  Honesty is about making it clear that the work that you are doing in credits everyone it should, and that you are not taking responsibility for work that is not your own.  Contribution to Community is the category that is the most specific to Notre Dame, and it is also probably both the most controversial.  It details responsibility to help others and contribute to the general knowledge of the department.  That being said, we both believe that this is a really important part of our academic growth, and is one of the biggest benefits of the Notre Dame community.  Respect has to do with honoring the value of the opinions and abilities of those around us, regardless of what we think ourselves.  Finally, Doing the Right Thing is about the greater world outside of our community, and our responsibilities to do good and keep our work from harming others and the environment.  <br />
One of the things that makes our code of ethics more important in this context is that it is very specifically tailored to students in the Notre Dame computer science program.  I would consider this both a strength and a weakness.  This is not solely a benefit because it does keep the number of people who it is useful for much smaller, as there are some rules that may only impact Notre Dame students; however, this means that for those students it is more useful than a generic code of ethics like ACM provides.  <br />
Personally, I believe that a code of ethics is not necessarily that useful, outside of the use as an exercise like this.  I think that the scale of our code of ethics here is quite limited.  If someone does not hold the same values as myself and Jeff, I am not sure that they would want to follow the direction that our document points you in.  However, I think that creating my own code of ethics here was really helpful in terms of making myself evaluate how I think that my peers and I should behave in our academic lives.  It is really easy to just plod along and do what I do without considering it, as long as I am not explicitly breaking any rules.  I think that it was good to take a step back and look at how I think that I should be behaving ideally, and how the way that I do act matches up with it.   <br />
