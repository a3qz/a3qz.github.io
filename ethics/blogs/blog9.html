I think that the most important part of our podcast is how, in each topic, rarely did each of those in our podcast have the same experience.  I think knowing that fact is useful because it can help keep someone a little bit more sane than normal, and (hopefully) help them know not to compare to their peers too much because everyone's journey is different.  I think that the section we provided the most constructive suggestions are is the discussions of preparations and resources to consider.  We offer a variety of options for how to prepare and what each of us felt like worked the best individually; someone who listened to our podcast would be presented with a lot of options that they could try out to try and see what works for them.  To be honest, I am not sure that there is anything that I know now that I didn’t know before.  The only things I could say are that I wished I had known how important it can be to take initiative and be pushy sometimes, and how important prepping is.  I definitely did not prepare enough and would not have done well on most interviews.  The best advice that I received is from someone that I met at my internship this summer, who told me that what is important is to stay current and always pursue work in areas that look like they will have a lot of growth in the short term future, to avoid getting stuck in a niche that is dying out.   <br />

I think that colleges should either adjust the curriculum or, if they have the resources, offer a more theoretical path and a more real-world path.   There is some value to learning the theoretical side of computer science, but there is also value in both the engineering side and the hacking things together side.  I think that the ND CSE curriculum has made some good changes recently, like removing Fundamentals 2, but I think that there are things that are just good to know that we don’t really get much experience with.  I think a course that taught practical skills would be incredibly useful.  The closest thing that we have is Systems, which is great, but we still lack a lot of practical skills.  I would bet that a large percent of the students in our program do not know how to do something basic like create and host a website quickly for a side project, make and read/write from a database, or write a unit test for some code that they worked on.  In my opinion, classes like Databases and Networks would be requirements, because not knowing the subjects from that class will most likely mean that once you get into the real world you will have to play catch up on them.  We might also benefit from a class like a slightly more intense Systems, where you just learn random but useful topics in computer use.  <br />
