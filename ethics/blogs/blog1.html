    <h1>Reading 00: Question 1: About Me</h1>
    <p>
        My name is Ryan Michalec. I am from the city Lake Orion, Michigan, which is in the Metro Detroit area.  The interest that has consumed the majority of my time growing up and that still takes up a good amount of my free time today is my interest in games.   When I was really young, I played lots of board games with my family.  I can even remember the time when I asked my parents for a video game console for the first time.  As I went through middle school and high school, most of my friends I made through video games in some way.  Even to this day, I continue to have games as a big part in my life, as the Xbox in my dorm room is almost always being used by someone, even if its not me. I even have a role in my dorm as the official Game Night Commissioner, where every couple of weeks I plan a board game or card game night and bring pizza for the residents of my dorm.  I would also say that this interest had a lot to do with bringing myself to the path of computer science, as a lot of my first experiences using computers at more than a surface level were all attempts to either modify games, create them, or just get them running on my laptop that was not necessarily strong enough to do everything I wanted it to.

        The reason that I am studying computer science is twofold.
        The first reason is because of my passion for problem solving.  I love solving problems and puzzles, be it logic games, puzzles in video games, or completing a programming assignment given constraints.  Computer Science and Software Engineering both give me the opportunity to do so, and therefore I find it a better fit for me than most other majors.
        The second reason that I am studying computer science is because of my love for the creation process, especially in an engineering sense.  Though no one would ever consider me artistic by any means, I have always loved to build things.  When I doodled in my notebooks in elementary school, instead of drawing pictures, I would always draw little mechanical designs that I wanted to try and build myself if I ever had the time and resources.   I love that computer science gives me the opportunity to build something up from small parts that I understand into something that I can be proud of, providing me a challenge along the way, and often solving a relevant problem as well.

        In conclusion, both reasons work together to make it so that doing computer science work is something that I find interesting, and that is why I am studying it.

        In my opinion, the most pressing ethical and moral issues facing computer scientists have to do with responsibility.   In "Programmers: Stop Calling Yourselves Engineers", the author provides examples of quality problems in software, sighting iOS phone bricking and downtime of critical online software.  More recently, we have seen huge leaks of information from corporations like Equifax, as well as issues such as the Meltdown and Spectre that have the potential to negatively impact huge numbers of consumers.  The issue of where responsibility falls, specifically as addressed in "The code I’m still ashamed of", is something that we as a culture must address.  The more closely that computers and code are integrated in our lives, the more chance there is that something can go wrong.  To some extent we are bound by requirements, but I think that where we draw the line, and where responsibility falls on the engineer, is something that we must come to terms with.  I also think that intellectual property is a very important part of computer science ethics that we must deal with as well.  There are a lot of subtleties to technology that makes it harder for traditional lawmakers to design appropriate policies around, and I think that what an appropriate policy would even look like is something important to discuss.
        The above are topics that I am looking forward to discussing in class.  I think that, especially with the topic of intellectual property, there are a lot of opinions that are in strong contrast to one another, and that the supporters of each side take for granted that everyone else is on the same side.  I think that hearing out these differences will be very interesting.  Another one that I am very interested in discussing is Computer Science Education.  I think that many of those in our class came to computer science in different ways, and I would be very interested in hearing our different opinions on how education in computer science should be done.
