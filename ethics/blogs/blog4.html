		</h1>Sun, 28 Jan 2018 21:45:59 +0000<p>My job and internship interview process has been fairly typical, though probably less severe than many of my classmates.  After my sophomore year, I had a couple of interviews that ended up being non technical where I found out that the companies were not really hiring sophomores.  The smaller consulting company that I ended up working for did not actually do a technical interview either, they just brought me in one day and I talked to the guy who ended up being my manager about my experiences in class, extracurriculars, and side projects.  That being said, as the summer went on it definitely felt like I was being hired more so that I could learn than for the value that I would bring to the company.  In that sense, though, what I was working on was perfect - I was working on a feature for a product they were developing for a client that was not part of what they were technically contracted for.  However, the solution that they were using before had a very unique feature (a score tracker for their internal squash leagues) that they were going to miss when they migrated, and since it was not mission critical but still a cool feature, they felt like it was safe to give to the intern.  For the next summer, I only got one interview with a big tech company, and another with a smaller company near to school.  The interview with the big tech company was fairly standard.  My first round was on campus with one interview with a technical-ish question and a bit of resume review.  Then for the final round, I went through five rounds of whiteboard questions all focused on data structures.  For this year, I did not interview much, but I did interview with one company whose first round was a fairly detailed question on HackerRank, but I did not move on from that round.  I think what surprised me the most about the interview process is how much I actually did not mind it.  I feel like we walk so much about the interview process in this field that nothing would really have come as a surprise in terms of content.  That being said, unlike many of my peers, I did not prepare at all for the interviews.  In fact, if I was not in Dr. Bui's Data Structures class while I was interviewing during Junior year I might not have been able to get the internship that I did.  This year, when I did my one technical interview (which did not result in me moving on), I felt a lot more out of touch with the content. <br />
<br />
Overall, my impression of the general interview process is that it is somewhere in the middle of the road.  I think that it is definitely reasonable that a company should have some sort of test for a potential hire based on what they would be doing at the job.  One article that specifically frustrated me was "When we only hire the best means we only hire the trendiest".   On one hand, it seems incredibly frustrating and almost objectively bad that employers discriminate against possible candidates because they have plenty of experience, just with technologies that are not fitting with the image of the company.  That idea really sounds pretty flimsy when you think about it - any good developer with experience could learn a new stack without an unreasonable amount of time for the transition.  That being said, the idea of a company or even generational gap around what technology is cool is definitely a real thing.  I experienced it myself this summer, where the interns and junior developers my team were all quite knowledgeable about technologies like React, Python, and NodeJS, and the senior developers were incredibly committed to the .NET environment.  The younger people expressed sentiments about how the .NET stack was old and uncool, whereas the senior people were very much of the mindset that whole JavaScript environment was a fad that wasn't ready to be taken seriously.  Because it is possible for a candidate to be dismissed due to these superficial qualms, it definitely seems like there is a lack of efficiency and effectiveness in the interviewing process.  However, specifically in the realm of technical interviews, you can definitely argue both ways for their efficiency.  On hand, it seems inefficient that tech companies have to give interview questions that test basic fundamentals - for instance, I have received questions that are basically testing whether or not I know what a class is in C++.  This seemed at the time like a waste of both my time and the interviewers time, but, when you look at it through the lens that Jeff Atwood puts it in "Why can't Programmers Program" via quoting other authors on the subject.  If it is really true that a majority of applicants to a programming role cannot program in the slightest, then who am I to say that asking such a trivial question is wasting anyone's time. <br />
<br />
I definitely think that saying that the interview process is inhumane is going too far.  It is entirely possible or even likely that the process is unfair; in fact, when you consider people that are very strong candidates but struggle to solve problems under the stress of an interview, it definitely does seem skewed towards those that are strong under the conditions of a technical interview.  You could argue that the inhumanity and ethical failings of the system are the way that it can strip out the humanity of a candidate and reduce them to a resume and results on technical questions.  However, many of the tech companies that we talk most about are so large that I feel like humanizing the interview process would cost a lot more then the return that they would get would be.  At least for me personally, I do not feel like these systems go against any obvious ethical principles.  <br />
<br />
An interesting comment that I want to make at the end of this is that, upon reflecting on my response, I feel as though I had a lot more to say about and that it was easier to talk about the efficiency and effectiveness of the interview process then whether or not it is ethical.  I wonder if this says something about me or if it is more reflective of the culture of the tech industry as a whole, or at least, the side of it that undergrads seeking jobs sees.  <br />
