    <h1>Reading 00: Question 2: Not just for Superheroes</h1>
    <h2>
        In my opinion, programming is not a super power.  In fact, I would say that if it was considered to be one, that would lead to dangerous implications.  The reading that spoke to my view most on this topic is “Programming as a super power” by Alfred Thompson.  As someone who is incredibly passionate about programming and computer science, I completely agree with the sentiment that it feels incredibly empowering when you discover that you can do things on a computer that other people cannot.  Sometimes, especially when talking about computer science in a group of people with a mixed range of knowledge about programming, it definitely is an ego boost that does make you feel like a super hero.  Things that are totally manageable, and even sometimes trivial, to those who understand programming, can seem impossible to those without a grasp of much of the detail.  On the other hand, as much as I love to feel like a superhero, I think it sets a bad precedent when there is thinking like that.  Thompson addresses a group of people that Microsoft calls “non-professional programmers”.  These are the people that are not career developers that create software, but just normal users that create programs to enhance what they are doing slightly.  One story that has stuck with me is when a friend told me while they were in Systems Programming that over a break, they helped teach their father who was slowly going through a list of names and addresses one by one to make updates how to use command line tools to really quickly finish his processing in one quick pass.  In my opinion, though I have no data to back it up, I feel as though there are tons of people in many fields that are really held back by their lack of knowledge of programming.  Though anecdotally it does sound as though this is improving, there are so many different uses of small self-contained computer programs that would totally improve the efficiency of everyday work tasks.  And even if programming ability does rely a lot on “innate ability”, like Dr. McGowan states in “Programming is not a super power”, it is still entirely possible to create useful programs without having a huge amount of natural capacity for a large working memory.  The dangerous implications of considering programming a super power are that this kind of thinking can lead to, like Hancock discusses in “Burn The Programmer!”, “a world which is increasingly splitting into those who can wield magic, those who can pay the magicians, and those who just use the things magic enables”.  Technology at the scale that we have it today gives us opportunity to break down obstacles that have historically been barriers to communication, with distance and language barriers approaching the point of trivial.  However, if during this process of increased communication, we manage to overlook also knocking down that barrier between those that can create and those that can consume, both sides of the wall end up worse off.  I can only offer a guess as to how the world would be if more people had an understanding of basic programming, but I would put my money on it being a more efficiently operating system than it is right now.
