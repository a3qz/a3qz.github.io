The concept of Corporate Personhood is that a corporation, since it represents a group of people with a common concern, legally has some of the protections (and maybe responsibilities) that the law extends to individuals.  The legal ramifications are that, since the Constitution does not specifically call out any provisions for or against corporations, that which rules affect them, and which do not must be decided in court.  This is exemplified in the article from The Atlantic "'Corporations Are People' Is Built on an Incredible 19th-Century Lie", which explains the history of Supreme Court cases that brought us to where we are today in terms of rights for corporations. The social implications are harder to pin down, but the most important that I can tell is the fact that many people instinctively hold corporations as socially responsible for the actions that they take and how it reflects their values.  Its impact on ethics is much the same; corporate personhood makes the ethical decisions of the corporations matter more because of how it impacts who is responsible for what.  This is reflected in the Hobby Lobby case, brought up by the article "If Corporations Are People, They Should Act Like It", which entailed the retailer arguing against having to provide coverage for contraceptive care that goes against the owners' religion.  <br />

The case that I decided to read about is the Microsoft Antitrust case.  I felt like this was relevant, because I will be working for Microsoft after I graduate.  That being said, even with a potential for bias, I do not stand on the side of Microsoft in this case.  I believe that what Microsoft was doing was definitely immoral, and fairly certainly unethical as well.  Like the Ars Technica article states, Microsoft tethered " its own Internet Explorer to every Windows PC system and simultaneously making it more difficult to install or pre-install Navigator".  The case against it was that by both making IE so integral to Windows, and making it more difficult to install competitors' programs, it was being predatory against other browsers, like Netscape Navigator (which, for context, at the time, most browsers were not free of charge like they are today).  The actions that they were taking here was objectively anti-competitive, which, in my personal ethical and moral opinion, goes against what companies should do.  The foundation of a functional capitalist system should be the increase of competition in order to increase economic efficiency and promote innovation.  I think that the enacted punishment, "make it easier for Microsoft’s competitors to get their software more closely integrated with the Windows operating system", which I do think was a required step; however, I think it set a bad precedent of anti-competitive measures by large tech corporations.  I think that breaking up its divisions into separate companies would maybe have hurt the company as a whole but would have benefited the industry in terms of the innovation and competition.  The best product should win, not the one who has the best head start, or the one that wasn’t crippled by its platform.   <br />

I think that yes, if we are going to agree that corporations should be afforded the same rights as individuals, they should be expected to have the same moral and ethical obligations and responsibilities as individuals. I tend to agree with the sentiments in the article "If Corporations Are People, They Should Act Like It".  It argues that "This separateness means that shareholders are not held liable for the debts of the corporation", and that this separation of person and corporation is what allows for the kinds of investment that we as a both a society and as individuals put into corporations.  Without some of the rights corporations receive thanks to Corporate Personhood, we would not have as bountiful of an economy as we have had.  And it goes without saying that there are some freedoms that people have that corporations should not have, with an example being how securities firms requiring the publicizing of corporations' financial information being fine for corporations but a First Amendment violation for people.  However, there are places where the corporations are abusing their freedoms.  I agree with the sentiment that " corporations should be seen as having robust social and public obligations that cannot be encapsulated in share prices".  This is an idea of stakeholder vs shareholder interests, in which companies currently prioritize shareholder obligations (raising stock value) over stakeholder (bringing positives to those impacted by the corporation).  That is where I think corporations should have the imperative to focus on moral and ethical considerations instead of just financial.  I think that this is relevant to the Microsoft antitrust case if we look at the implications that it has had.  Now, we see devices like the iPhone, which has packed in software and built in policies that extend far beyond what Microsoft had done with Internet Explorer in terms of making software competition impossible, that are not even questioned.  In the IE case, Microsoft put what they stood to gain over the massively negative impact on innovation and efficiency over the years because of the implications of their case.  It is easy today for people my age to forget how dominant Microsoft was at one point in time, and how different of an industry we would probably see had it been forced to split up its divisions into separate entities.   <br />
