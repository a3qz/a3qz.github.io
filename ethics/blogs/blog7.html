			Reading 04: Diversity is an issue, what do we do about it

I think that this issue is an incredibly complicated one.  I don't think that it is really possible to take either side of this argument without being wrong in one way or another - given one exception that I want to get out of the way immediately.  No matter your stance on whether there is a valid gender and/or racial gap in technology, and if there is something we need to do about it or not, the harassment that seems so pervasive across the industry is needs to end.  The amount of data and number of personal stories of unwanted sexual advances and general inappropriate treatment of women shows how much of a problem this is.  What happened at Uber is inexcusable.  I also think that a lot of recent events have shown that this problem extends far beyond the tech industry though, so I will leave it at this for now.  <br />
<br />
 I still think that it is hard to take one side or another on the issue of the gender gap.  Clearly it exists, but I think that it lies somewhere between an unfortunate reality and a problem that needs to be fixed.  Two of the most capable technical minds amongst that I know amongst my peers are both women.  However, (and I cite this article thinking that a lot of people choosing the "it is not a problem" route of argument will latch onto it) "As a Woman in Tech, I Realized: These Are Not My People" puts into context something that I think makes my experience make sense.  When the author says, "But I was never going to like it enough to blow a weekend doing more of it for free", I think of myself and the others I know.  The women that I just referenced are not like this author, and enjoy using their free time to do technical projects.  That being said, at least in my personal life, I know five or ten times the number of men that do "work" in their free time than I do women that do.  Things like that make it harder to tell whether or not the imbalance has something to do with the nature of the genders rather than something cultural.  I think that stories like this put the industry in a difficult position.  The tech industry has a very specific culture.  Due to historic reasons, like apparently post WWII Intel, according to "Why Is Silicon Valley So Awful to Women?", this culture has been shaped almost entirely by men for men.  That basically gives the industry two choices, either try and change the culture so that it is more open to women, or try and find more women that fit in.  I don’t know what the right answer is, because I think both have potential benefits and negatives.  Maybe one solution that falls in the middle is trying to get more exposure to tech at younger ages to try and find the women that would be more tech minded but aren’t solely due to lack of exposure.   <br />
<br />
I think that what needs to change before any of that is attitudes.  One of the people I mentioned before once told me that they were considering making a lot of changes to their appearance and their mannerisms so that they would be taken more seriously by others in their field.  I know that the idea of stereotypes and appearances are a human thing not a tech thing, but that frustrates me.  I know that I will probably never have to worry about my appearance, because my default appearance pretty much fits in exactly with the software engineer stereotype.  One story I remember from an internship experience that I have is walking into a room with a client alongside some of my coworkers, and the clients immediately (and correctly) assuming this I was the developer because of how I looked.  I don’t think that is fair at all though, and that we should be able to look past the superficial and judge people on their abilities.  <br />
<br />
Another article that I found intriguing was "I'm not a woman in tech".  I had read it before and found it just as curious then as I do now.  I know that my words will be taken with a grain of salt because I am a straight white male, which basically puts me in the bracket for "most privileged".  That being said, I think that what this author says does somewhat ring true of the danger of the current status of "Women in tech".  I see this relating to two different things that I see in my daily life.  One is a side effect of "Women in tech" being a thing.  There are a handful of women that I have interacted with that seem to care a lot more about being a woman in tech then they actually care about tech.  I don’t care about your gender or what you represent.  I care about computers.  I find it frustrating to deal with people so concerned about putting forward a certain image.  It seems inauthentic and insincere when someone who is so proudly "in tech" has more to say about the gender politics of it then they actually do about tech.  I do not mean to try and devalue the importance of discussing gender in tech, I think having those conversations is almost required at this point in order to mature as an industry.  However, I think you need to have a strong backbone and passion about tech first.  <br />
The second thing is more about what the author discusses - that is, the fact that the "Women in tech" movement can at times bring in an us vs them mentality that is potentially just as damaging as it is helpful.  This is a difficult thing to take a side on, however.  I know several women in my life whose careers were greatly benefited by programs specifically focused to help bring in women in the field.  However, I have also witnessed firsthand problems and negative attitudes brought on by such programs.  One quote the author of this makes that I think rings true is "If you actually wanna say “look, women can do this too” – inspect your unconscious biases and nominate the women who deserve it for the not-only-for-women awards!".  It spurns unnecessary segregation when you try to specifically promote any one group.  It also in some ways backfires, and can lead to perception that women receiving those awards aren’t as capable as those who are winning awards that have competition in both genders.  I even know men that have strong negative attitudes about things like the networking events at women in tech conferences - and I think this author probably has seen that too.  I have even felt it myself, at some points.  It can feel frustrating that the pro women in tech events are so active, with exclusive networking events, career fairs, and panels, when the benefits that those of us with privilege are for the most part passive.  The benefits that I get from my gender are more like how people assume I fit in and can be taken seriously.  It is hard to appreciate what we have when it is a lot less tangible, even if it is still ultimately better.  Again, I have no idea what the solution to these problems could be. It seems like the obvious solution is just to treat everyone equally and with respect, but human beings don’t exactly have a great track record of doing that.  <br />
