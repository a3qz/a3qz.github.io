I am not really sure that men and women can really have it all.  That being said, I do still think that it is okay to not have it all, and that we can still live productive and satisfying lives without really "having it all", and in fact that having it all might not even be that desirable at all.  Often times, in my personal life, when I find myself without any particular struggle, I can find myself feeling bored, restless, and sometimes even depressed.  When something is going wrong in my life, I am probably less healthy, and can definitely get stressed, sleep deprived, and irritable.  However, I would also say that when I am like that is when I do my best work.  Maybe it is a personality thing, but I find myself able to be the most productive and most clear thinking when I am under a lot of pressure and disarray.  For a minor but still relevant example, I dislike working at a clean desk or in an organized space.  I am much more comfortable, at home, and productive when my work environment is cluttered - to me, it feels more lived in.  <br />
<br />
In my opinion, having it all means being truly happy and content.  If you have it all, you do not need to work towards anything anymore, you can just do what you do and be content with that.   One quote that has stuck with me about this, though a little cheesy, is from the Will Smith movie Pursuit of Happyness: " It was right then that I started thinking about Thomas Jefferson on the Declaration of Independence and the part about our right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. And I remember thinking how did he know to put the pursuit part in there? That maybe happiness is something that we can only pursue and maybe we can actually never have it. No matter what. How did he know that?".  I feel like it speaks a little bit to human nature.  From my admittedly limited experience, having to work hard and pursue something you don’t have can be the parts of life that are the most rewarding.  I think that my own experiences in life growing up may have had something to do with this.  For most of the childhood, my dad had a really long commute to work, so most days he would not get home until later in the evening then would be expected from the hours he worked.  My mom stopped working when I was born, so she was always around as well.  In theory, it sounds like we probably should have had it all - both parents were around, we never struggled to put food on the table, etc.  In hindsight, it does seem like we had it all.  However, I do not think that was the case.  I don’t know if my mom would admit it or not, but by the time my brothers and I were in high school, I wouldn’t be surprised if she felt a little bit lonely and would have found it more fulfilling to get back into the workplace then to continue just helping us out.  I also think that my dad being unable to move us closer to his work because of our school was actually a lot more of a stressor on him then he really let on.  Driving for close to as many hours as your workday can wear you down.  <br />
<br />
I have definitely felt guilt over missing out on certain portions of my life.  To be totally honest, I am still not sure that I have overcome that situation at all.  If I did not enjoy the work that I do, I think that I would be very miserable.  I consider myself very fortunate that I do.  I think that growing up I missed out on a lot of potentially formative activities because my parents kept me so focused on work.  I hope that as I grow older I will be able to shed these habits, but we will see.  Potentially, I will be like the author of "Why do we work so hard", trapped working all the time but hopefully on something that I enjoy doing and care about.  <br />
<br />
I think that to some extent companies are responsible to not overwork their employees.  That being said, I think there are multiple ways to deal with it, and all are reasonable.  The best way is to make sure that managers keep the requirements on employees at a sane level.  It can be a difficult balance to strike, but it really does need to be the baseline level.  Beyond that, there are things that can be good to have but are not required in my opinion.  I think that having organizations such as recreational sports leagues, or even just a gym on premises, can be really nice, giving employees healthy outlets for energy not related to their jobs.  <br />
<br />
Personally, I think that I have been able to manage avoiding burnout by balancing my activities.  I always make my responsibilities first priorities, but I also try and balance in both fun activities, such as playing sports outdoors, and playing video games.  Something else that I do that I think also helps is doing programming outside of work/class.  Doing projects that I want to as opposed to ones that I have to is a good way to reinvigorate my passion for programming and software engineering.  I think that my strategy is somewhat similar to the one proposed in "The reality of developer burnout", and hopefully it will work for both me and the author.  <br />
