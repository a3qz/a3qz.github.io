Net neutrality is the concept that the internet service providers should not be able to provide different internet speeds based on what content is being delivered.  The IEEE article explains net neutrality as the idea that internet service providers "ought to deliver all online content to consumers in the same way, without granting preferential treatment to any particular content."  The arguments against it are that it would give more money to the service providers which would incentivize them to further develop their network, as currently many areas are more or less monopolized by the isp in the area and therefore don’t currently have a lot of reasons to improve.  The counter to that is that it will have the opposite effect, and instead of trying to improve the networks, they will just make all connections slower and only the companies that pay more will get the level of service that currently everyone gets.  The expected negative impact of this is that it would be taking funds that currently fund content creation and instead be going straight to isps that are still monopolies with no reason to invest it.  After examining the topic, I am incredibly pro net neutrality.  I think that the only reason to be against it is if you benefit from large sums of money going into the pockets of network industry executives (which funnily enough the head of the FCC does).  If I had to implement and enforce it, I would make it illegal to discriminate different services.  I would ideally like to see internet service treated as a utility or have the costs of creating one subsidized by the government so that some actual competition could exist.  I don’t think that the place we need innovation is changing infrastructure in areas that already have it.  Content creators innovating has a much wider potential for creating good than companies that provide services.  Over-regulation can be a problem in many industries, but interrupting a monopoly is not over regulation.  The only reason that I personally was not as crazy about this issue as many others rightfully are is that I feel jaded, and that the current American culture does not value freedom and fairness as much as it does maximizing the value of the few on top.  In that view, net neutrality makes no sense because it moves towards those who may actually use it.  <br />

I do think that internet access is almost a right at this point.  Personally, I think that basic rights of someone in the world of today should include access to information and communication, and the internet is the single best way to get access to both of those things. I personally do not know how I feel about the idea of an unbridled free market.  I do not trust the free market in that I do not think that it necessarily brings the most efficiency.  However, I also have an issue with the government intervening in most areas, because I do not especially trust that those in the government are the ones with the most information or experience in making the right decisions.  Just like in the article 'Am I The Only Techie Against Net Neutrality?', though I may not go as far as him, the author says that "The U.S. government has shown time after time that it is ineffective at managing much of anything.".  Something I read once but have been unable to find since is a quote about power and authority.  It goes something like: "The people that are capable of getting in power are those that are the least qualified to have it, and the people that are most qualified to have it are those that will never want it".  I believe that is fairly true.  Between bias and misinformation, I don’t trust many things about large systems, both corporations and governments.  <br />
