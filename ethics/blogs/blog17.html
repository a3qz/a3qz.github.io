			Reading 12: Copyright  
		</h1>Sat, April 14, 2018<p><br />
According to the US Copyright clause, copyright is the power that Congress has "To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries".  It literally means "the right to copy a work".  Copyright is the legal protection granted to the creator of some intellectual property.  The reasons for granting them are in order to foster innovation and creation.   The idea behind them is that if, for example, and author wrote a novel, and anyone else was able to redistribute or sell it, then that would discourage the author from wanting to actually write and publish anything.  However, initially, copyrights were not designed to last forever, usually expiring after a reasonably long period of time, and renewable if the author was alive after the period ended.  In the US, the length of copyright has gone from a maximum of 28 years to what can now be as many as life of the author + 70 years.  (Cited from the Wikipedia article about the US Copyright clause).  When a copyright ends, rights to reproduction and distribution of that work are in the public domain, and therefore anyone can reproduce the work.  <br />
I think that there are a lot of times when an open source license should be preferred over proprietary.  When software is being developed inside a company, it will have inherently less eyes on it and get less mileage.  Allowing the software to be open source gives there the chance for more developers to see what is going on.  It brings the option to add more features or refine the ones that exist, because external developers might have different use cases or rely more of different part of the programs.  However, I think that the biggest reason not to support open source is when, as cited in the article "Corporations and OSS Do Not Mix", accountability becomes a factor.  When there is a bug in open source software being used by hobbyists, if they have to either wait a couple weeks or fix it on their own, that is not the end of the world.  However, if a company relies on that software for their business, and they absolutely need a bug fixed, they do not have the power or influence over the developers of that project that they need in order to get themselves back to a working state.  I do think that open source is inherently more pro-consumer, but whether or not that is deter depends on your own opinion.  I think that things like Heartbleed go a little out of proportion; there are plenty of big issues with proprietary software too - remember Meltdown and Spectre.  <br />
I do think that the distinction between Open Source and Free software is important.  They describe two different things.  According to the Free Software Foundation, free software means that "the users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software".  In "Why Open Source misses the point of Free Software", Stallman cites the OSI definition of Open Source Software, which include the basic idea of access to the source code, but also the creation of derived works and the prevention of restricting and discrimination of access.   They describe similar things, however, in order to be classified as open source, the restrictions on what that means are a lot more permissive than what is strictly free.  I donâ€™t think it is fair to say that I prefer BSD over the GPL, because they are very different.  From a strictly supporting freedom perspective, I think BSD is great, because it is so much more permissive.  However, from a furthering the free software agenda, the GPL is better because it enforces copyleft. For this reason, I think that I would say BSD is freer, because it does have less restrictions.  I personally find the Beerware License or the WTFPL to be my preferred license.  <br />
In my opinion, the court is not correct in saying that an API is copyrightable.  I do not think that having the language available yet restricting certain of its features for some use cases but not others makes no sense and goes against what the rule reads to me as intended for.  I think that the court is relatively correct saying that Google is in fair use and is incorrect when it ruled that Google was in fact infringing on anything.  An api for a language is something that is just a part of it and should not be considered external.  It would be different if Google had done something like reverse engineered a binary that they had purchased.  Because of the details of this case, I am on Google's side.  <br />
